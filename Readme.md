This is a plugin for MediaMonkey 4.0 for performing music quizzes

Usage:
- Create a playlist with songs that should be guessed and select the playlist
- Press \<Begin Quiz\> and it will randomize all songs from the current playlist and put them into the Now Playing list. Also a new playlist is created named 'Quiz of \<Year-Month-Day\> [(n)]'
- A fullscreen window appears with some control elements
- Pressing \<Play\> will play the first song in the Now Playing playlist
  again
- The player will stop after the song is played and hitting \<Play\> again will restart the song from the beginning
- With \<Show Information\> the song's information is shown, specifically 'Album', 'Title', 'Artist', 'Comment' and 'file path\file name'
- \<Next\> will move the current song into the quiz playlist, clear the displayed information and play the next song

TODO (from source):
- Change playback time, when TrackBar changes (might need buttons)
